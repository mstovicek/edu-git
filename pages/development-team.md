## Development team

Different from other methods, in Scrum a team is not just the executive organ that receives its tasks from the project leader, it rather decides self dependent, which requirements or User Stories it can accomplish in one sprint.
It constructs the tasks and is responsible for the permutation of those – the team becomes a manager.
This new self-conception of the team and the therewith aligned tasks and responsibilities necessarily change the role of the team leader/project leader.
The Scrum Master does not need to delegate all the work and to plan the project, he rather takes care that the team meets all conditions in order to reach the self-made goals.
He cleans off any impediments, provides an ideal working environment for the team, coaches and is responsible for the observation of Scrum-rules – he becomes the so-called Servant Leader.
