## Product owner

One of the most important things for the success of scrum is the role of the Product Owner, who serves as an interface between the team and other involved parties (stakeholders).
It can be said that in companies that use scrum, the tasks and responsibilities of the particular Product Owner are never the same.
Starting with the choice of that person provided with the proper and necessary skills, make them take specific trainings, up to the responsibility they take; the role of the Product Owner –short PO- is the most complex one regarding that procedure.

Often the PO has to “fight” on both sides.
Whereas the team can work a certain fraction of time (time boxed) “protected” by the Scrum Master, the Product Owner often needs to deal with marketing, management or the customers in order to be able to present the software requirements (User Stories) quite precisely to the team (see the box “criteria for User Stories).

Furthermore the Product Owner is responsible for the return on investment (ROI).
He validates the solutions and verifies whether the quality is acceptable or not from the end-users’ point of view.
He also has to decide over the importance of single features in order to prioritize these in their treatment and he has to tell the team what the product should look like in the end (product vision).
Since one of the teams’ tasks is to work effectively, the Product Owner must react fast on call-backs.
Hence he fulfills the role of a communicator, as he must be in contact with all stakeholders, sponsors and last but not least the team throughout a project.
After all it is his task to coordinate the financial side of the product development, which is successful through his continuous work and prioritizing the advancing tasks (Product Backlog).
All these diverse requests demonstrate how important the selection of the “right” person for the role of the PO is for the success of a project.

The nomenclature is definite.
The Product Owner is at Scrum not only the manager of a product, but also the Owner and therefore he is the one responsible for the correct creation of a product.
Being a Product Owner means:

- You are responsible for the success of the outcome of the product delivered by the team.
- You make Business decisions of importance and priorities.
- You deliver the vision of the product to the team.
- You prepare the User Stories for the team of development.
- You should possess severe domain knowledge.
- You validate the outcomes and test them for their quality.
- You react promptly on callbacks.
- You communicate on a continual base with all Stakeholders, financiers and the team.
- You control the financial side of the project.
