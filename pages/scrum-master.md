## Scrum master

The most obvious difference between a team leader and a Scrum Master is represented by the name itself though.
Whereas one is leading the team and sets the tasks, the other one is in charge of observing that the team obeys the rules and realizes the method of Scrum entirely.
The Scrum Master does not interfere into the decisions of the team regarding specifically the development, but rather is there for the team as an advisor.
He only interferes actively when anybody of the team or any other participant of a project (Stakeholder) does not obey the rules of Scrum.
Whereas a team leader often gives requirements and takes responsibility for the completion of those, an experienced Scrum Master gives only impulses and advises to the team to lead the correct way, to use the right method or to choose the right technology.
In fine the Scrum Master acts more like a Team Coach than a team leader.
