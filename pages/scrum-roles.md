## Scrum roles

In contrast to classical project management methods, Scrum doesn’t have and doesn’t need a product manager, a taskmanager or a team leader. 

The most important three roles of Scrum are:

- [Product Owner](product-owner.md)
- [Scrum Master](scrum-master.md)
- [Development team](development-team)

These three roles are coequal and all of them have certain responsibilities, of which I want to name a few.

The Product Owner is responsible for the vision of a product, the gathering and the prioritization of the requirements, control over the budget and the ROI.

The Scrum Master cleans out problems, takes responsibility that the rules of Scrum are kept and he as well coaches the team.

The team of Scrum is a self-organized unity, responsible for the creation and the quality of the product.
Besides these three roles there exist some more Stakeholders, who e.g. serve as an observer or a counselor.
